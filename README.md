# 3D-ICDAS_based_tooth_classification
This repo features code for an experiment on 56 restorative cavities on simulated molars using four ICDAS classifications. 3D scans analyzed surface area, volume, Hausdorff distance, and Dice coefficients. Multivariate analysis and 3D CNN assessed cavity size, operator proficiency, and predicted ICDAS class.
